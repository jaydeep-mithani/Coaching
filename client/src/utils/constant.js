Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes. Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. <span></span> <strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms. <span></span> <strong> Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. </strong> Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: London, UK. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled. <span></span> <strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. <span></span> <strong>   Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. </strong> If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties. <span></span> <strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim. <span></span> <strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company. <span></span> <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. <span></span> <strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. <span></span> <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. <span></span> <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. <span></span> <strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement. <span></span> <strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. <span></span> <strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court. <span></span> <strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement. <span></span> <strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party\'s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement. <span></span> In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands County, California, for such purposes. <span></span> The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations. <span></span> Company is located at the address in Section 10.8.

For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal obligation that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hard copy writing. <span></span> <strong>Entire Terms.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word "including" means "including without limitation". If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

I feel like I am growing in ways that I never expected and seeing things in a healthier, positive light rather than being in the dark all the time. I’d rather heal through a spiritual aspect than clinical. I’m continuing my sessions and I’m really and truly thankful for coming to them for more of a spiritual awakening.`,

    review: `This is the greatest investment I have made in life. So impressive the way Rita trained me specially in respect of manifestation. She always went out of her way to help me out and was always available for me to clarify any issues and challenges I faced till I get my expected outcome. I am happy to say that I am now blessed with all what I have manifested with the kind guidance with Rita. I just have to say wow. Excellent services. Highly Recommended. Thank you so much Rita!`,

    review: `The best thing I've ever chosen to do is develop and have mental freedom for myself. But I couldn't have been the person I am right now without the tools that Rita has gifted me. If I'm honest, I couldn't escape being a prisoner to my mind and the trauma I never asked for, but the teachings, wisdom, &amp; tools that these two incredibly gifted &amp; authentic women give you are priceless. After going through their course, I can say I'm present in life; after 33 years, I finally figured out how to show up for myself and started to love myself and see the endless possibilities that the universe has to offer you. This experience has been a breakthrough for me, and every day I see the change in me, and every day I take my power back and own what’s mine, which is me and seek what truly fulfils me.`,

    review: `With Rita’s help, I've been able to summon amazing things into my life, like reconciling with a lost love. I am beyond astonished by what I've obtained, and I'm left wondering if this is all too good to be true. It's as if my ex was a rusty lock, and I had been unable to open it until you showed me how to align the key to fit the lock - now, the door is unlocked and I'm able to access the wealth that had been hidden away. Your teachings are like a golden key, life changing. Thank you I wasn't expecting to manifest this quantity of money now. I'm shocked I am so thankful for the best reader I have ever encountered! Rita has an uncanny ability to accurately predict my future and to make me feel so much more uplifted and positive. I am truly grateful that the universe has brought them into my life!`,

    review: `I recently had my 3rd spiritual reading with Rita, and I was astounded of the accuracy predictions of future events. I decided to follow spirit guidance to reconnect with an ex- partner, that I missed dearly for almost 2 years. To my surprise, my ex-partner was more than happy to reconnect, and we are now happily together. This experience has convinced me that spiritual readings with the right people are incredibly powerful and accurate. I will not look anywhere else for readings. You are gifted and your kindness brings tears to my eyes. Forever grateful`,

    review: `Rita truly goes above and beyond. She is so amazingly gifted that there are things she picks up. A lot of things she says is scarily accurate. There is no need for you to give her any information because she picks up on anything and everything. I really enjoy my sessions with Rita because she takes her time and never rushes. She even gives you opportunities to ask any questions you may have during the session. She has definitely been my go-to from the start and I highly recommend her. She truly is a beautiful soul. Don’t hesitate to purchase a session with her because she is the truth. She is the real deal. Thank you for all that you do Rita. You are a beautiful soul- inside and out.`,

Just wow…I went from 0-100 within hours after just one ritual as there is two for this…can’t wait to do the second one. My partner also got a fantastic job with the money he asked for over those days so abundance and success all round. Amazing and so powerful. I will update with a review at the end of the course. The love ritual was also powerful…but I won’t go into that! I would highly recommend this course; it would be a good investment for anyone to make…the returns are amazing`,
